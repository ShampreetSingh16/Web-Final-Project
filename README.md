# Web-Final-Project
# Name : SHAMPREET SINGH
# Humber ID: N01545002

# Pages Made :

All the pages are responsive using media query and each page has a hamburger navbar which is displayed when user view our site on mobile.
All the pages are validated using html and css validator.

1) Index Page - It is the home or landing page 
Added a search functionality in navbar so when user enter name of a city lets say toronto and click on search icon they are redirected to respective page and also added a slideshow using javscript and when user clicks on an image in slideshow they are redirected to respective page whose image was clicked.

2) FAQ Page - It is a simple faq page 

Added the toggle javascript in this page and also hamburger navbar to make it responsive

3) Feedback Page - It is a simple feedback form asking user to enter their details and give their opinion about our site.
Added form validation using javscript

I also created a fourth page that we initially decided to make (Contact us page) my team decided not to remove that page but it is not for evaluation.

# Challenges and Curves :
Had some challenge while designing the layout but figured it out after trying different things and javascript was not working initially but with help of teammates solved the issue.
